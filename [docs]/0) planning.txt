My countries (top left, following to right etc):
	Ivorygal (top left)
	Libgyptia
	Congola (left mid)
	Kenyopia (right mid)
	Nambafrica (bottom)
	Madagascar

	World (black)

Idea:
	Make "world" produce ice cream every x seconds
	Make each country consume africa each x seconds
	Make shipping from world to africa and then decide where to place it
	Unlock new countries by purchasing ice cream rights / bribing army
	Possible to purchase new factories in world to produce more ice creams

Game end:
	How many ice creams can you sell in a year?
	1 month = 5 minutes	
	12 months = 60 minutes
	possible to double time
Score:
	money left * 1
	ice creams sold * 4 (will probably need some kind of other multiplier?)
	each country unlocked = money_needed
	money spent * 0.75

Expansion:
	Possible to advertise in countries to increase demand
